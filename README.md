# The-Impact-of-Group-Identity-on-Coalition-Formation



Bargaining and coalition building are a central part of modern politics. We argue that majoritarian bargaining is important for the formation of political coalitions and that group-identify preferences impact partner selection. We test the effect of gender, race and ideological distance in a majority-rule bargaining experiment and find that ideological distance significantly affects offers made to potential partners. We conclude that preferences for similar coalition partners can help predict which coalitions form, even in the absence of policy concerns.
